        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will display the three different tabs that will be on the site. The main purpose of this home page is to inform people/customers of where the company is based out of and the services offered. Then it will show case all of the different options that are available to them for a remodel or new construction. They can see a bathroom remodel or living room remodel  and the different ways they can remodel their home and have inspiration on what can be done for them. They can also see the different kinds of materials that will be used and how they can be cut or custome-mdae for their needs.

      <h3>Origin story</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone loves an origin story or pathos. The main purpose of this story is to share where my uncle came from and what inspired him to start his own business and when he started it. People are more trustworthy when they feel like they know you and can be your friend. I want to share how my uncle has run this business out of his garage for years now and how he works countless hours to complete his different projects and also lets the customer know that they know who they are getting into business with.
