                        <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                            given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of
                            the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river
                            that they never left.</p>
                        <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                            over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                        <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                            undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and
                            colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good
                            rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late
                            summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
